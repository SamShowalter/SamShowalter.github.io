                        I am a Technology Consultant and Data Scientist currently working for West Monroe partners. I have a mixed background of research and industry experiences. Ultimately, I hope to pursue a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on integrating computer vision, knowledge extraction, and reinforcement learning to assist in augmenting machine perception under uncertainty.
                        <br> <br>
                        My previous research is equally diverse. In both high school and early in college I worked at Purdue University as a visiting researcher in Dr. Suzanne Bart's inorganic Chemistry group. However, most of my recent work utilizes Machine Learning techniques to optimize business or societal practices. These projects include optimizing credit card fraud detection for cost minimization and validating the weak-form efficient market hypothesis with price-based classification systems and algorithmic trading. Only a slight exception to this rule is my work with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) where I developed software to simulate quantum state tomography to inform techniques for high fidelity qubit measurement in quantum computers.

                    Selected as one of 21 students and new graduates in the country to join the NIST laboratories of Boulder, Colorado. Operating within the Information Technology Laboratory, I developed quantum state tomography software to simulate qubit measurement by a computer. Our interdisciplinary group was predominantly theoretical and interested in maximizing the fidelity of qubit measurements without facilitating decoherence. My simulation experiments identified peculiar qubit behavior when measured under different purity and optimization methods. Collaboration with experimental groups to test our theories was common.

                    Data Science arm of Kroger stores. Developed and outlier detection system in SQL to programmatically parse incoming Controlled Store Test (CST) data for executional errors. CSTs allow Kroger and its consumer packaged goods (CPG) providers (P&G, Burt's Bees, etc.) to experiment with different store layouts and product packaging. These tests are difficult to conduct because holding extraneous variables constant is extremely difficult. My task was to validate testing data was suitable for further analysis and not greatly impacted by confounding factors. Ultimately, my solution ran in less than 30 seconds and detected over 85% of known executional issues historically, saving analysts 4 - 8 hours per test.

Mentored by PhD student John Kiernicki and worked to generate Rhodium and Iridium organo-metallic complexes by successfully attaching organic ligands to the structure. Metal-mediated organic transformations with f-block compounds, particularly those with low oxidation states, are difficult to conduct. Over the summer I was able to generate one Iridium crystal structure of adequate quality, and determine its resulting structure using H1 NMR (certified over summer), IR spectroscopy, and other diagnostic tests.

                After briefly considering a career in analytical Chemistry, I transistioned my focus to Applied Mathematics and its intersection with Economics and Computer Science. This quickly led me to the growing field of Data Science, for which I grew a strong passion that extended beyond the classroom. With the help of a few friends, I launched DePauw's Data Science Group (DPUDS) in 2017. This group focused on cultivating interest in and awareness of Artificial Intelligence through teaching, demonstrations, informal discussions, and competitions. Over the two years I served as its President, DPUDS procured multiple sources of funding, won Data Science hackathons, completed over a dozen projects, and grew to be one of the largest groups on campus. I graduated in 2018 with degrees in Mathematics and Economics, Summa Cum Laude.

                            Characterizing quantum bits (qubits) is an essential aspect of quantum computing and quantum information science because successful quantum computation requires high fidelity preparation, manipulation, and measurement of qubits. However, fully characterizing qubits with a single measurement is impossible. Therefore, quantum state tomography (QST) – estimating a quantum state using a collection of measurements of copies of that state – is necessary to characterize experimental quantum devices...

                        <h3>Hunger Snakes: Neuroevolution of Fixed Topologies and Advsersarial Learning</h3>
                        <p align = 'left'>
                            There are many examples on the internet of developers and Data Scientists utilizing Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies to teach the agents of simple computer games to play (Snake, Mario Bros., etc.). However, few of these implementations conduct such an experiment under adversarial circumstances, when multiple agents compete for limited resources. In this project I build, <b>from scratch</b>, an adversarial implementation of Neuroevolution for the game snake. For simplicity, topologies were fixed for all agents based on a common fitness function.

                        <p align = 'left'>
                            The CalTech256 Image dataset (LINK HERE) was created to assess the performance of different image classification models, particular under different input data size (number of photos) constraints. Using a transfer learning model build on the Xception classifier, myself and small team I led were able to achieve a holistic macro and micro F1 Score of 86% across all classes. We then integrated this model into a frontend web application where a user can upload any photo and see the top 10 class prediction probabilities as well as the overall prediction.

                            The MNIST dataset from the U.S. Postal Service is one of the most commonly used datasets when teaching optical character recognition with basic convolutional neural networks. After seeing a Javascript and Lua implementation here (ADD HREF), I decided to see if I could build something similar, but with more transparency into the process and completely in Python. The solution I completed was 98 percent accurate for classifying numbers.

                        <p align = 'left'>
                            Markov Chains are simple networks that rely on probablistic state transfer. These transfer probabilities are based on a specific corpus, something that can be unfluenced by the user. This project allows the user to upload a text file (PDF support coming shortly!) and then generate a unique story with the style of the input authors. This process will include all punctuation and spacing is provided by the system, allowing for stylistic spacing like in poetry to be accommodated.
